        I am a backend developer learning frontend development. I have a
        particular interest in indie hacking and becoming full stack is my
        current path to that. I plan to learn how to make things simple and how
        to automate daily tasks. I try to keep up with security and best
        practices, and I am always looking for new things to learn.
